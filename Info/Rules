# Crazy Eights Rules

### Objective
The main goal of Crazy Eights is to play all the cards from your hand. The first player with **no cards remaining** is the winner.

### Starting the Game
- The deck is shuffled and 7 cards are distributed to each player (card count of starting hand varies depending on player count).
- The remaining cards are placed face down as the **Draw Pile**.
- Flip the top card from the draw pile and place it face up to begin the **Discard Pile** (if card is 8, reshuffle it into the deck and flip another card).

### Playing the Game
- Decide the turn-order of players.
- The current player must play a card that matches the suit or the value of the card on top of the **Discard Pile**.
- If the current player cannot play a card from their hand, they must draw a card from the **Draw Pile** until they get a playable card.
- Turns continue in this fashion until one player plays their **last card**.

### The Crazy Eight
- All 4 '8' Cards in the deck are special cards and can be played regardless of the **Discard Pile's** top card.
- The player who plays an '8' card must specify the suit of the next card played.
- The next player must match the specified suit or play an 8 to avoid drawing a card.
